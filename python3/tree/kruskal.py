I actually learnt how it works but I have no idea how to even get started with the inputs... 
Just gonna leave this docstring here for future me to update it when I am better.

Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that continually finds uses the minimum cost edges
to determine the minimum cost spanning tree. If the minimum cost edge selected will cause a
cycle in the spanning tree, it will be discarded, and the next minimum cost edge will be used
instead.

While the typical implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), it can
be improved to O(n Log n) using min heaps.
