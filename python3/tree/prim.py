I actually learnt how it works but I have no idea how to even get started with the inputs... 
Just gonna leave this docstring here for future me to update it when I am better.

Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that uses the following steps to determine the minimum spanning tree.
1. Find the lowest cost edge first. This edge will determine the starting vertices.
2. Find the lowest cost edge that are connected to the created tree.
    (ie if edge (1,2) is selected in the first step, then the next edge selected has to be the lowest of those connected to vertice 1 and vertice 2.)
3. Repeat step 2 until you achieve the required number of edges, which is |V| - 1, or number of vertices - 1.
